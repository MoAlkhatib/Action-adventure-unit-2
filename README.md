# Action-adventure-unit-2
Objective: Maze game
Skill increase
So far, when you needed some input from the player, you always just asked them to input some text (ReadLine). That's not going to be good enough for an action adventureâ€”you need to know how to react directly to key presses (ReadKey).
Mission: BOSS LEVEL
Objective: Maze game
Part 1
Today you'll be putting interactivity into the Minotaur's Lair project, so pull that code up and get ready to upgrade it.

To make it into a bit more of a game experience, how about adding a title screen to greet the player?

Completion goals:
In the Minotaur's Lair project, before you display the map, output the name of the level and prompt the player to press any key.
Wait for the user to press any key before proceeding to draw the map.
In the DrawMap method, set the console cursor to position (0,0) before drawing the maze.
